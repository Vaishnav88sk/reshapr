/**
 * A Service responsible for offboarding organizations and users: the counterpart of
 * {@link OnboardingService}. It cascades the removal of an organization together with all its
 * dependent data (services and their artifacts / configuration plans / expositions, secrets,
 * gateways, gateway groups, quotas, API tokens, shared resources and user memberships), and the
 * removal of a user together with its API tokens and memberships.
 *
 * <p>Exposition removal is delegated to {@link ServiceManagerService#deleteService(String)} which
 * itself relies on {@link ConfigurationPlanManagerService} and {@link ExpositionManagerService},
 * so cluster-wide deletion events are broadcast to listening Gateways before rows are dropped.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code reshapr} root organization cannot be deleted, and its owner user is protected
 * from deletion as well.</p>
